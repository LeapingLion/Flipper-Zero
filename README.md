This was a research project to learn about the capability of Flipper Zero and present our knowledge to people through The MacEwan Ethical Hacking Club (club.eh). In the process of the research, we learnt a lot about various forms of contact and wireless technologies and how Flipper zero worked with them. Some of these technologies included:
(a) Bad USB
(b) Radio frequency Identification (RFID)
(c) Near Field Communication (NFC)
(d) Wifi
(e) Infrared
(f) Bluetooth
(g) iButton
